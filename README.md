## This Machine Learning with Python course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known, programming language. You'll learn about Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning, look into how Statistical Modeling relates to Machine Learning, and do a comparison of each.

## Look at real-life examples of Machine learning and how it affects society in ways you may not have guessed!

## Explore many algorithms and models:
- Popular algorithms: Classification, Regression, Clustering, and Dimensional Reduction.
- Popular models: Train/Test Split, Root Mean Squared Error, and Random Forests.

## RECOMMENDED SKILLS PRIOR TO TAKING THIS COURSE  

### You have to do hands-on lab for this course. The tool that you use for hands-on is called Jupyter and it is one of the most popular tools used by data scientists. If you are not familiar with Jupyter, I would recommend that you take our free Data Science Hands-on with Open Source Tools.
 
### This hands-on lab requires that you have working knowledge of Python programming language as it applies to data analytics. If you don't feel you have sufficient skill in Data Analysis with Python, I recommend you take Data Analysis with Python courses.
